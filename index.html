                <p>My lifelong experience in retail work has honed my ability to empathize with customer needs. I was trained in customer service by the Army and Air Force Exchange Service. This attention to detail helped shape the methodology I approach every occupation with. I like to have all of the data at the ready, whether it's floor layouts in a store or documentation for tech-related projects. I pay attention to what works well for the customer and provides the best experience to facilitate engagement and drive progress. I like to make an impact. I'm no stranger to hard work, be it physical or mental. While I have spent most of my time in the retail sector, I firmly believe that customer service and enhancing the customer experience are essential concepts that are universal to all businesses. I have spent time in customer service positions, resolving issues with billing, technical support, and account administration for companies such as Blizzard Entertainment. My time at Blizzard is a point of pride for me because I had to fight for that position. I competed with nearly 1000 other people for one of 10 positions available after my temporary work contract with the company. Those of us who made it worked so diligently that our work helped Blizzard reassess the duties of junior, or tier 1, Blizzard employees. We demonstrated that skills such as in-depth game log searches and in-game item restoration could be taught to a high degree of competency at the earliest stages of involvement.</p>
                <p>I am also no stranger at overcoming adversity. I'm a survivor of abuse, and have had to fight to maintain consistency with therapy and treatment to reclaim my independence and self-sufficiency. I currently live in Canada with my partner, having spent several years gathering resources and planning. I am unable to obtain a work permit yet, so I took the initiative to learn HTML and CSS, passing the certification exam for Codecademy.com. I am on track to finish their full-stack development training. I am more than competent with hardware, and I now have an excellent grasp of web development concepts. I am eager to take that mastery to the next level and find work where I can contribute. Throughout my learning process, I've completed projects for school that provided me with relevant media (images, video, etc) and wireframes, and created responsive content based on those criteria. I'm a strong believer in really dialing in the responsiveness of a project so that one HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file is all that is needed to create dynamic content that is usable across all devices. I possess excellent communication skills and have developed the ability to work effectively with teams to plan projects and devise solutions to challenges.</p>
                <p>Outside of work, I love to write. I have written a novel that is currently being edited, and I'm working on a nonfiction book about applying Stoic philosophy to enjoy the hobby of gaming. I've also been producing music for 4 years with my record label, Pixel Rodent. I've had tracks signed to Mojo-Headz Records and released several albums. My musical endeavors have landed me spots on the soundtrack for the upcoming game, Super Power Racing. I strive to channel conservative creativity into every detail of my life. I enjoy creating intense, innovative content that doesn't try to be the main feature of the experience, but rather augment it in a way that makes the biggest, most balanced impact. I look forward to hearing from you and can't wait to get started creating.</p>
