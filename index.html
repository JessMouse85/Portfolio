                <p>My life-long experience as a retail work has honed my ability to empathize with customer needs. I was trained in customer service by the Army and Airforce Exchange Service. This attention to detail helped shaped the methodology I approach every occupation with. I like to have all of the data at the ready whether it's floor layouts in a store, or documentation for tech-related projects. I pay attention to works well for the customer and provides the best experience to facilitate engagement, and drive progress. I like to make an impact. I'm no stranger to hard work be it physical or mental. While I have spent most of my time in the retail sector I strongly believe that customer service and improving the customer experience are crucial concepts that are universal to all business. I have spent time in customer service positions resolving issues with billing, technical support, and account administration for companies like Blizzard Entertainment. My time at Blizzard is a point of pride for me because I had to fight for that position. I competed with nearly 1000 other people for one of 10 positions available after my temporary work contract with the company. Those of us who made it worked so diligently that our work helped Blizzard reassess the duties of junior, or tier 1 Blizzard employees. We proved that things like deep game log searches, and in-game item restoration were things that could be taught to a high degree of competency at the earliest stages of involvement.</p>
                <p>I am also no stranger at overcoming adversity. I'm a survivor of abuse, and have had to fight to maintain consistency with therapy and treatment to reclaim my independence, and self-sufficiency. I currently live in Canada with my partner after several years of gathering resources, and planning. I am not able to get a work permit yet, so I took the initiative to learn HTML, and CSS, passing the certification exam for Codecademy.com. I am on track to finish their full-stack development training. I am more than competent with hardware, and now I have an excellent grasp of web-development concepts and I am eager to take that mastery to the next level and find work that I can contribute to. Throughout my learning process I've completed projects for school that provided me with relevant media (images, video, etc) and wireframes, and created responsive content based on those criteria. I'm a strong believer at really dialing in the responsiveness of a project so that one html, css, and JavaScript file is all that is needed to create dynamic content that is usable across all devices. I have excellent communication skills and have learned to work well with teams to plan projects, and provide solutions to challenges.</p>
                <p>Outside of work I love to write. I have written a novel that is currently in the process of being edited, and I'm working on a non-fiction book about using Stoic philosophy to enjoy the hobby of gaming. I've also been producing music for 4 years with my record label Pixel Rodent. I've had tracks signed to Mojo-Headz records, and release several albums. My musical endeavors have landed me spots on the soundtrack for the upcoming game, Super Power Racing. I like to channel conservative creativity into all details of my life. I like to create intense, innovative content that doesn't try to be the main feature of the experience, but augment it in a way that makes the biggest, balanced impact. I look forward to hearing from you, and can't wait to get started creating.</p>
