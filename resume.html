                <p class="sub-title">Dear Sir or Madam,</p>

                <p id="cover-letter">I have been working retail and customer service jobs for over the past twenty plus years. I put the customer first in all things. In retail, I sought to build good business by giving retail customers the best experience possible in all situations. I, am dedicated, responsible and punctual. I do not like taking shortcuts, and I'm a strong believer that work assignments can be done right and done expediently. My extensive retail experience has led me to become an effective leader, and planner. I want to bring this passion and dedication to your web-development team, as I learn more, and grow. I am currently being trained in Full-stack development and have mastered web design fundamentals. I am also well-acquainted with source control through both git integration in Visual Studio, as well as Git Desktop.</p>
